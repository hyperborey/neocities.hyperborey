Today is the first day when I started this blog. Currently, I did not even made proper markdown parsing for my blog posts, so If you're reading it today this text would look like a mess.

I don't know what really say here though.

I made basic `index.html`, some *very* basic styles and scripts to build the website. I have a lot of plans to actually improve the whole thing, but I don't want to overwhelm myself.

Also, my English fucking sucks. It's hard to get all your thoughts out when you never actually spoke the target language. So, except a lot of grammatical errors. I'm not going to fix them ever :3
